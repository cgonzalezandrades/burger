# Burger App
---

#### But Why ?
##### The purpose of this application is to delete Hamburgers from a database created in Mysql. Once the burger is deleted from such, the page will update and will allocate the correct data in the **_Devoured_** side of the page while at the same time it will delete the burger from the **_Eat one of these_**.

##### Users can also add a new Burger to the Database. 

## This app is using:

#### 1. Node.js
#### 2. JavaScript
#### 3. CSS
#### 4. HTML
#### 5. MySql
#### 6. Handlebars
#### 7. npm Pacckages
 * Express
 * body-parser
 * mysql
 * express-handlebars
 * Method-Override
