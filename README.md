#### But Why ?
##### The purpose of this application is to delete Hamburgers from a database created in Mysql. Once the burger is deleted from such, the page will update and will allocate the correct data in the **_Devoured_** side of the page while at the same time it will delete the burger from the **_Eat one of these_**.

##### Users can also add a new Burger to the Database.
